# setup-jlo

`setup-jlo` is a single TypeScript GitHub Action repository.
The public contract is `action.yml`.
The authored runtime is under `src/`.
Tests are under `tests/`.
Documentation is under `docs/`.
Automation is under `.github/workflows/`.

## Repository Layout

`action.yml` defines action inputs and outputs.
`src/` contains runtime boundaries (`action`, `app`, `domain`, `adapters`, `catalog`).
`tests/` verifies boundary behavior.
`docs/` contains usage and architecture references.
`.github/workflows/` contains static checks, tests, E2E validation, and release automation.

## Validation Entrypoints

`just fix` runs formatting and safe lint fixes.
`just check` runs format, lint, and typecheck validation.
`just test` runs the Vitest suite.

## Constraint

Normal development changes do not update `dist/`.
